Clock Synchronization Models for BLE Devices
=============================================

This module provides clock synchronization algorithms for mapping device timestamps
to LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) time. The main challenge is handling Bluetooth buffer
bloat - variable latency spikes caused by BLE connection intervals and packet queuing.

SYNCHRONIZATION VALIDATION SUMMARY (January 2026)
-------------------------------------------------

Extensive testing was performed using a dual-device photosensor experiment:
- Two Muse S Athena headbands (old + new firmware) simultaneously streaming
- External light sensor (BITalino) as ground truth reference
- Screen flashing at ~5Hz for 30+ minutes
- Compared event onset detection across different clock models

**KEY FINDINGS:**

    ┌─────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────┐

    Average OPTICS jitter (both devices combined):
    1. windowed:     23.7 ms  ★ RECOMMENDED
    2. robust:       71.6 ms
    3. standard:     77.6 ms
    4. adaptive:     91.6 ms
    5. constrained:  91.7 ms

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Default choice: WindowedRegressionClock ("windowed")**
   - Best overall stability across different devices
   - 100% event match rate for both old and new firmware devices
   - Handles variable BLE transmission delays well

2. **Alternative: RobustOffsetClock ("robust")**
   - Good for older/more stable devices
   - Uses percentile-based offset tracking
   - May struggle with high-jitter devices

3. **Avoid for timing-critical applications:**
   - AdaptiveClock: Can have 5x higher jitter on some devices
   - ConstrainedRLS: Strong slope constraint can cause offset drift

**WHY WINDOWED WORKS BEST:**

The WindowedRegressionClock fits a local linear regression over a sliding window
(default 30 seconds). This approach:
- Adapts to gradual clock drift without overcorrecting
- Doesn't assume constant offset (unlike offset-only models)
- Doesn't over-constrain slope (unlike ConstrainedRLS)
- Re-fits periodically (every 1s) rather than on every packet

**PHYSICAL BASIS:**

Crystal oscillators in Muse devices are highly stable (<<1% drift). The main
source of timestamp variability is NOT clock drift but Bluetooth buffer bloat:
- Packets queue at BLE connection interval boundaries
- Variable RF conditions cause transmission delays
- The "offset" between device and LSL time is actually the sum of:
  - True clock offset (stable)
  - Variable queuing delay (0-50+ ms jitter)

All clock models try to separate these effects, but windowed regression does
it most robustly by fitting a local linear model that tracks the minimum
latency envelope without being fooled by buffer-bloated packets.

USAGE
-----

In stream.py, set the `clock` parameter:

    python -m OpenMuse stream --clock windowed  # ★ RECOMMENDED
    python -m OpenMuse stream --clock robust
    python -m OpenMuse stream --clock adaptive
    python -m OpenMuse stream --clock constrained
    python -m OpenMuse stream --clock standard

Or use None/"none" to disable clock synchronization entirely and use raw
device timestamps (not recommended for multi-stream experiments).

class RobustOffsetClock:

    Key design principles:
    1. **Fixed slope = 1.0**: Crystal oscillators are extremely stable. Any apparent
        drift is due to buffer bloat, not actual clock skew. We ONLY track offset.

    2. **Robust offset estimation**: Use a weighted median approach on recent samples
       to reject outliers (buffer-bloated packets) without the instability of
       minimum-envelope tracking.

    3. **Windowed history**: Maintain a sliding window of offset measurements,
       giving more weight to recent samples while being robust to outliers.
